/*
  In order to implement the code, for the simulation of the structures proposed in the assignment,
  the team-work strategy is that to divide the implemetation between: 
  implementation of the most optimized method of resolution to check the live/dead cells (coder1),
  display/visualization (coder2) and the creation of the menu options (coder3).
  
  For the options menu, the idea is that to provide the options to choose the structure to simulate,
  before starting the simulation, the mode of simulation (automatic/manual), and quit the game.
  !!! For the selection of the options, please use the touch-pad !!!

  During the simulation is provide a legend (HelpBox) on the left side ofthe window, in which are specified 
  the buttons to select the several options available: quit game (q), restart game (r), play/pause (p) 
  (please press "p" to start the simulation) and the modality of running that can be automatic or manual 
  (please press the right arrow on the keybord (->) to make a step forward in the simulation).
